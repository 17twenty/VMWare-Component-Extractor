VMWare-Component-Extractor
---------------------------

This is just a personal itch scratcher after fighting with VMWare a little bit on Windows 7 and it giving me a really odd error - It is in no way endorsed/affiliated with VMWare.


This program, given a VMWare component file, will extract the ISO you need to mount to provide you with the host utils.

Just make, no install needed.
